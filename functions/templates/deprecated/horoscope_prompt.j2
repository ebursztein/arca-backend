PERSONALIZATION DATA (from {{ user.name }}'s journey)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{{ memory.format_for_llm() }}

Use this personalization data to:
• Build continuity with previous readings
• Reference themes they've been exploring
• Avoid repeating the same guidance
• Create a sense of journey and progression
• Show you "know" them intuitively through accumulated wisdom
• Connect today's transit to their ongoing story

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR TASK: Generate Today's Personalized Reading
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Create a daily horoscope following this EXACT structure. Every section should be grounded in the KEY PERSONAL TRANSIT identified above, showing how that core energy manifests across different life domains.

---

1. DAILY_THEME_HEADLINE (1 sentence, max 15 words)

A compelling, shareable wisdom sentence that captures today's PRIMARY energy from the key transit.
This should be profound, poetic, and actionable - perfect for a push notification.

Requirements:
• Must reflect the core theme of the key personal transit
• Use metaphor or paradox for depth
• Include implied action or choice
• Be universally resonant yet personally specific

Examples of strong headlines:
• "The bridge you're afraid to cross is made of the very thing you need most."
• "Today, your vulnerability becomes your most magnetic quality."
• "What feels like an ending is actually permission to begin differently."

---

2. DAILY_OVERVIEW (2-3 sentences)

Set the emotional and energetic TONE for how today will FEEL for {{ user.name }}.
Connect the astrological mechanics to lived experience.

Requirements:
• Address {{ user.name }} directly with "you" voice
• Describe the subjective feeling of today's energy
• Reference the key transit's influence
• Use elevated, mystical language
• Create anticipation for the depth below

Example structure:
"Today, [emotional tone from transit], as [technical aspect]. You may feel [specific sensation], {{ user.name }}, especially around [life area activated]. This is [cosmic purpose/meaning]."

---

3. KEY_ACTIVE_TRANSIT (4-5 sentences)

THIS IS THE ENGINE OF PERSONALIZATION. Provide technical astrological analysis that establishes credibility.

Requirements:
• State the EXACT aspect with degrees: "Transit [Planet] at [degree]° [Sign] forms a [aspect type] to your natal [Planet] at [degree]° [Sign]"
• Explain what each planet symbolizes
• Describe the nature of the aspect (harmonious/challenging/dynamic)
• Name the natal house being activated
• Explain the core archetypal theme

Example:
"Transit Saturn at 15° Pisces forms a precise square (90°) to your natal Moon at 14° Gemini, located in your 3rd house of communication and learning. Saturn, the cosmic teacher, brings structure and maturity to the Moon's emotional realm. Squares create productive tension - this is not a punishment but a crystallization point. Your 3rd house activation means this shows up in how you think, speak, and process information. The lesson: emotional intelligence requires both feeling AND discernment."

---

4. AREA_OF_LIFE_ACTIVATED (2-3 sentences)

Specify the CONCRETE LIFE DOMAIN being spotlighted by the key transit.

Requirements:
• Name the house being activated (from the key transit's natal house)
• Explain what this house governs in practical terms
• Connect to {{ user.name }}'s lived experience
• Use "your [house]" language for personalization

Example:
"This transit activates your 7th House of Partnerships and one-on-one relating, {{ user.name }}. This is the realm of marriage, business partnerships, and anyone you engage with as an equal. Over the coming days, your closest relationships become the classroom where today's cosmic lesson unfolds."

---

5. ACTIONABLE_ADVICE (structured format with 3 parts)

Provide CONCRETE guidance that empowers choice. Use this EXACT format:

DO: [Specific action aligned with the transit energy]
• Must be concrete and achievable today
• Should leverage the opportunity in the transit
• Use active verbs

DON'T: [Specific thing to avoid]
• Must address the shadow/pitfall of this transit
• Help them avoid the lower expression
• Frame constructively

REFLECT ON: [A powerful question for journaling]
• Should unlock self-awareness
• Connect to the deeper soul lesson
• Open-ended, non-leading question

Example:
DO: Write a letter expressing a difficult truth to someone you've been avoiding. You don't have to send it, but articulate what needs voice.

DON'T: Retreat into intellectual analysis when emotions arise. Your feelings are data, not problems to solve.

REFLECT ON: If my fear of difficult conversations was protecting something precious, what would that be? And is that protection still serving me?

---

6. LUNAR_CYCLE_UPDATE (3-4 sentences)

Provide RITUAL and WELLNESS guidance based on today's Moon.

Requirements:
• Name the Moon phase and what it means spiritually
• Describe the Moon sign's emotional coloring
• Reference the house the Moon is transiting in {{ user.name }}'s chart
• Offer a specific ritual, practice, or self-care suggestion
• Connect to feminine/receptive wisdom traditions

Example:
"The Waning Crescent Moon {{ transits.lunar_phase.phase_emoji }} in {{ transits.moon_sign.value.title() }} asks you to release and dream, {{ user.name }}. At only {{ transits.lunar_phase.illumination_percent }}% illuminated, this is the Moon's most mystical phase - the time before the new beginning. In your {{ transits.moon_house.ordinal }} house of {{ transits.moon_house.meaning }}, this lunar energy {{ lunar_moon_interpretation }}. Ritual: {{ transits.lunar_phase.ritual_suggestion }}. Honor the dark of the Moon by resting your striving."

---

7. GENERAL_TRANSITS_OVERVIEW (list of 2-4 bullet points)

Brief, evocative notes on COLLECTIVE transits that color everyone's mood today.

Requirements:
• Focus on fast-moving planets (Moon aspects, Mercury, Venus, Mars)
• Keep each bullet to one sentence
• Use poetic language
• Show how collective energy interacts with personal chart

Example:
• Moon sextile Venus at 3:47 PM UTC - a window of grace for difficult conversations
• Mercury in Libra weighs every word on the scales of consequence
• Mars slowing before retrograde - action requires more conscious intention now

---

8. LOOK_AHEAD_PREVIEW (2-3 sentences)

Create anticipation for UPCOMING transits to encourage daily return.

Requirements:
• Highlight a significant transit in next 2-5 days
• Be specific about timing ("in 3 days" not "soon")
• Provide preparatory action or mindset
• Create useful tension/anticipation

{% if upcoming_transits %}
Example from upcoming transits:
"Heads up, {{ user.name }}: In {{ upcoming_transits[0].days_away }} days, {{ upcoming_transits[0].description }}. This is a significant evolutionary moment. Begin softening the ground now through awareness and honest self-inquiry."
{% endif %}

---

9. TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS (3-5 sentences)

Explain the astronomical "why" behind today's energy. Reference specific planetary movements, aspects, and transits from the cosmic energies above.

This provides credibility and grounds mystical insights in real celestial mechanics.
Use accessible language but be specific about degrees, planets, and aspect types.
