YOUR TASK: Generate Detailed Predictions (Prompt 2)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The fast horoscope established the foundation. Now expand with collective context and detailed life domain predictions.

---

1. GENERAL_TRANSITS_OVERVIEW (list of 2-4 bullet points)

Brief, evocative notes on COLLECTIVE transits that color everyone's mood today.

Requirements:
• Focus on fast-moving planets (Moon aspects, Mercury, Venus, Mars)
• Keep each bullet to one sentence
• Use poetic language
• Show how collective energy interacts with the personal transit already identified

Example:
• Moon sextile Venus at 3:47 PM UTC - a window of grace for difficult conversations
• Mercury in Libra weighs every word on the scales of consequence
• Mars slowing before retrograde - action requires more conscious intention now

---

2. LOOK_AHEAD_PREVIEW (2-3 sentences)

Create anticipation for UPCOMING transits to encourage daily return.

Requirements:
• Highlight a significant transit in next 2-5 days
• Be specific about timing ("in 3 days" not "soon")
• Provide preparatory action or mindset
• Create useful tension/anticipation
• Connect to the key transit theme from fast horoscope

{% if upcoming_transits %}
Example from upcoming transits:
"Heads up, {{ user.name }}: In {{ upcoming_transits[0].days_away }} days, {{ upcoming_transits[0].description }}. This is a significant evolutionary moment. Begin softening the ground now through awareness and honest self-inquiry."
{% endif %}
