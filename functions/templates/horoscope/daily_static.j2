## YOUR PROCESS (REQUIRED BEFORE WRITING)

### Step 1: Identify Today's Dominant Story
1. Look at **overall_intensity** and **overall_harmony** unified_quality
2. Find the **highest unified_score** meter(s) - this is where the action is
3. Check the **top_aspects** of that meter - this is your main transit
4. Note the unified_quality (harmonious/challenging/mixed) - this sets the tone

### Step 2: Find Supporting Themes
1. Look at meters with unified_score > 60 - these are active today
2. Check which unified_qualities dominate (more challenging or harmonious?)
3. Find patterns across domains (e.g., career high + relationship low = work-life tension)

### Step 3: Ground Everything
Every statement must trace back to:
- A specific meter's top_aspects (planet, aspect, house)
- The meter's unified_quality or state_label
- Real transit data, not generic astrology

---

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### 1. DAILY_THEME_HEADLINE
**Data Source:** Use the **highest unified_score meter** + its **unified_quality** + **overall_intensity level**

**Formula:**
1. Identify the meter with highest unified_score
2. Check its unified_quality (HARMONIOUS, CHALLENGING, MIXED, QUIET, PEACEFUL)
3. Check overall_intensity level (quiet/mild/moderate/high/extreme)
4. State directly: [Life area] + [quality] + [intensity level] + [one concrete implication]

**Example Process:**
- career_ambition has highest score (85)
- unified_quality = CHALLENGING
- overall_intensity = 68 (moderate-high)
- Output: "Career pressure is high today with challenging energy pushing you to prove yourself"

**More Examples:**

*High challenging energy:*
- "Relationship tension peaks today—expect friction that forces honest conversations"
- "Your money and values area is under intense pressure to change"
- "Career ambition hits crisis mode with tests around your professional authority"

*High harmonious energy:*
- "Creative energy flows strong today—opportunities open easily in romance and self-expression"
- "Your beliefs and worldview expand as harmonious energy brings clarity and growth"

---

### 2. DAILY_OVERVIEW
**Data Source:** Use **top 2-3 highest unified_score meters** + their **state_labels** + **overall_intensity**

**Formula:**
1. Start with user's name + overall_intensity level (quiet/mild/moderate/high/extreme)
2. Name the life areas of top 2 meters using house language
3. Use each meter's state_label to describe how it feels
4. Mention overall_harmony quality to set emotional tone

**Example Process:**
- overall_intensity = 65 (moderate)
- Top meters: career_ambition (85, state: "High Stakes"), relationship_harmony (48, state: "Friction")
- overall_harmony = MIXED
- Output: "Jordan, today feels moderate but focused—like several things need your attention at once. Your career and reputation area is at high stakes with big tests happening, while your partnerships are experiencing some friction. The day's energy is mixed, so you'll feel pulled in different directions."

**More Examples:**

*High intensity + challenging:*
- "Maya, today feels intense and heavy. Your emotional resilience is fragile with deep feelings surfacing, while your career ambition faces major challenges that test your limits. The overall energy is challenging, so expect to work through difficult moments."

*Moderate intensity + harmonious:*
- "Alex, today feels active but flowing. Your decision quality is at peak wisdom with clear thinking supporting you, and your opportunity window is favorable with doors opening naturally. The overall energy is harmonious, so trust the process."

*Low intensity + peaceful:*

---

### 3. TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS
**Data Source:** Use **top 3 highest unified_score meters** + their **top_aspects** (exact planets, degrees, aspect types)

**Formula:**
1. State the #1 transit from highest meter: "Planet X at [degree] [aspect] Natal Planet Y at [degree] in your [house]"
2. Explain what this aspect means in simple terms
3. Mention if it's applying/separating (check meter's additional_context if available)
4. Add 1-2 supporting transits from other high meters
5. Include Moon phase/sign for emotional context

**Example Process:**

- Moon: Waning in Virgo (6th house)
- Output: "Pluto at 301° Aquarius is forming a tight square to your natal Saturn at 212° Scorpio in your career area—this is the peak of a test around your professional authority. At the same time, Venus at 185° Libra opposes your natal Mars at 5° Aries in your partnership zone, creating tension between independence and connection. The Waning Moon in Virgo supports practical problem-solving in your daily routines."

**More Examples:**

*Outer planet transit + personal planet support:*
- "Neptune at 357° Pisces is conjunct your natal Venus at 2° Aries in your relationships area—this blurs boundaries and heightens romantic idealism. Meanwhile, Mars at 95° Cancer squares your natal Mercury at 5° Libra, bringing heated communication in your learning zone. The Full Moon in Taurus grounds these intense emotions in your values area."

*Multiple challenging aspects:*
- "Saturn at 15° Pisces opposes your natal Sun at 18° Virgo in your identity sector—this is a reality check on who you've been versus who you're becoming. Jupiter at 85° Gemini squares your natal Moon at 88° Pisces, expanding emotions but creating restlessness. The New Moon in Scorpio asks for deep emotional release in your transformation zone."

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 sentences
- Use exact degrees and aspect names from top_aspects
- Explain what each aspect means simply
- Keep sentences under 25 words
- Ground in real data, no generic astrology

---

### 4. SUMMARY
**Data Source:** Use **top meter's interpretation** + **its top_aspects** + **user's sun sign**

**Formula:**
1. State what's changing (from top meter's life area)
2. Connect to top_aspects: which planets are involved and what they're doing
3. Tie to user's sun sign personality trait
4. Make it forward-looking and empowering
5. Use DIFFERENT house synonyms than Daily Overview

**Example Process:**
- Top meter: career_ambition (interpretation: "Significant career challenges...")
- Top aspect: Pluto square Saturn
- User sun sign: Gemini
- Output: "Today's planets are pushing you to rethink your professional reputation and what you're known for. Pluto is forcing deep transformation while Saturn tests your foundations—this is about rebuilding your career structure on more authentic terms. As a Gemini, you adapt quickly, but this asks you to commit to something lasting rather than keeping your options open."

**More Examples:**

*Challenging relationship transit:*
- "The planets are testing your one-on-one relationships and how you connect with others. Venus and Mars create tension between what you want and what you're willing to compromise on—this is about finding balance between independence and intimacy. As a Leo, you need to be seen, but this asks you to consider what your partner needs too."

*Harmonious career transit:*
- "Today's energy expands what's possible in your public image and achievements. Jupiter opens doors while the Sun illuminates your path—this is about stepping into bigger opportunities with confidence. As a Capricorn, you're naturally ambitious, and this supports you taking the next level seriously."

*Mixed mental transit:*
- "Your thinking and communication patterns are getting a shake-up today. Mercury brings clarity while Uranus brings unexpected insights—this is about breaking old thought patterns and seeing things differently. As a Virgo, you like order, but this asks you to embrace mental flexibility."

**Requirements:**
- 2-3 sentences, under 50 words total
- Reference the actual planets from top_aspects
- Use second set of house synonyms (not same as Daily Overview)
- Connect to sun sign in simple way
- Empowering tone even if challenging

---

### 5. ACTIONABLE_ADVICE
**Data Source:** Use **top meter's advice** + **its top_aspects** + **meter's state_label**

**Formula:**
- **DO:** Make the meter's generic advice specific with timing/method/quantity
- **DON'T:** Address the challenging aspect's shadow (if meter quality is challenging) or the harmonious aspect's pitfall (if quality is harmonious)
- **REFLECT ON:** Create question from the core tension in top_aspects

**Example Process:**
- Top meter: career_ambition (advice: "Patience and persistence required")
- Top aspect: Pluto square Saturn (challenging quality)
- State: "High Stakes"
- Output:
  - DO: "Before 3 PM, write down exactly 3 career fears you're avoiding. Then write one small action you can take on each this week."
  - DON'T: "Don't let Pluto's intensity make you burn bridges or quit impulsively—this transformation needs Saturn's patience, even though it feels urgent."
  - REFLECT ON: "What would your career look like if you stopped performing and started being authentic?"

**More Examples:**

*Relationship harmony challenging:*
- DO: "Between 6-8 PM, have a 15-minute uninterrupted conversation with your partner where you listen twice as much as you speak."
- DON'T: "Don't let Venus-Mars tension push you into saying something you can't take back—your need to be right is less important than connection."
- REFLECT ON: "What would change in your relationships if you asked for what you needed without apologizing?"

*Mental clarity harmonious:*
- DO: "Use the morning hours (8-11 AM) to tackle your most complex problem—your mind is exceptionally sharp right now."
- DON'T: "Don't waste this Mercury-Jupiter clarity on busywork or endless scrolling—use it for what actually matters."
- REFLECT ON: "What decision have you been avoiding that you now have the clarity to make?"

*Opportunity window mixed:*
- DO: "Make a list of 5 opportunities in front of you. Circle the 2 that feel most aligned with your values, not just exciting."
- DON'T: "Don't let Jupiter's expansion trick you into overcommitting—Saturn reminds you that real growth requires focus."
- REFLECT ON: "What opportunity would you say yes to if you weren't afraid of outgrowing your current identity?"

**Requirements:**
- **DO:** Ultra-specific action tied to meter's life area with timing
- **DON'T:** Name the actual challenging dynamic from top_aspects
- **REFLECT ON:** Question that addresses the core tension between the two planets in top aspect
- Ground in meter data, not generic advice

---

### 6. LUNAR_CYCLE_UPDATE
**Data Source:** Use **emotional_intensity meter** + **Moon's phase/sign/house** + **emotional_resilience state_label**

**Formula:**
1. Name Moon phase and its meaning
2. State Moon sign + house it's transiting in user's chart
3. Connect to emotional_intensity meter's unified_quality
4. Use emotional_resilience state_label to guide ritual type
5. Provide exact ritual steps (30-60 seconds)

**Example Process:**

- emotional_intensity = 35, quality = PEACEFUL
- emotional_resilience = "Strong"
- Output: "The Waning Gibbous Moon is the 'gratitude phase'—time to acknowledge what's worked. The Moon is in Virgo in your daily work and health area, bringing calm, organized emotional energy. Your emotional intensity is peaceful right now, and your resilience is strong. **Ritual:** Set a 5-minute timer. List three things in your life that worked this month. Say 'thank you' aloud to each. Close your eyes and take three deep breaths. Done."

**More Examples:**

*New Moon + challenging emotions:*
- "The New Moon is the 'fresh start phase'—time to plant new intentions. The Moon is in Scorpio in your intimacy and transformation area, bringing intense emotional depth. Your emotional intensity is high and challenging right now, but your resilience is fragile. **Ritual:** Light a black candle. Write one thing you're ready to release on paper. Burn it safely. As it burns, speak one intention for what you'll build in its place. Blow out the candle. Done."

*Full Moon + harmonious emotions:*
- "The Full Moon is the 'culmination phase'—time to celebrate what's come to fruition. The Moon is in Leo in your creativity and joy area, bringing expressive emotional energy. Your emotional intensity is uplifted and harmonious right now, and your resilience is strong. **Ritual:** Stand somewhere you can see the moon (or face a window). Raise your arms overhead. Say aloud one thing you're proud of this month. Bow. Done."

*Waxing Moon + mixed emotions:*
- "The Waxing Crescent Moon is the 'commitment phase'—time to take action on your intentions. The Moon is in Gemini in your communication area, bringing restless emotional energy. Your emotional intensity is mixed right now, and your resilience is variable. **Ritual:** Grab a pen and paper. Write for exactly 3 minutes without stopping about what you're building right now. Read it once. Fold it and keep it in your pocket today. Done."

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 sentences
- Name Moon phase, sign, and house in user's chart
- Reference emotional_intensity quality and emotional_resilience state

## CRITICAL RULE: GROUND EVERY STATEMENT

1. A specific meter's unified_score, unified_quality, or state_label
2. A specific top_aspect from that meter (planet, aspect, house)
3. Real transit data provided in the meter's top_aspects

**If you can't cite which meter + which aspect supports a statement, delete it.**

**Test yourself:**
- "Career pressure is high" → Traced to career_ambition meter (unified_score=85, quality=CHALLENGING)
- "Pluto is forcing transformation" → Traced to top_aspect: Transit Pluto square Natal Saturn
- "Your partnerships feel tense" → Traced to relationship_harmony meter (state="Friction")
