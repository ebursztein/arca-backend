# DAILY HOROSCOPE SPECIFICS

**Input:** TODAY'S ENERGY FOCUS data and User Profile. If a connection is featured, you will also receive CONNECTION VIBE data about that specific person.
**Output:** A valid JSON object containing personalized daily guidance.

---

## 1. Understanding the Input Data

Each meter group shows:
- **Score (0-100):** Higher = better. 50 is neutral.
- **Driver:** The specific meter causing this group's state (with its own score)
- **What it is:** Plain English explanation of what this driver measures
- **Planets tracked:** Which natal planets are monitored for this meter
- **Why:** The transit aspect causing this reading
- **The move:** How to write about this state - FOLLOW THIS GUIDANCE
- **Trend:** How this meter is changing compared to yesterday (when available)

### The 4 Quality Buckets
Scores map to 4 distinct states. Know where you are:

| Score Range | Quality | What It Means | How to Write About It |
|-------------|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| 0-25 | **Challenging** | Actively difficult. Real friction. | Be direct about the struggle. Name what's hard. Then give a concrete way through. |
| 25-50 | **Turbulent** | Unsteady. Not terrible, but not reliable. | Acknowledge the instability. "Choppy waters" energy. Advise caution, not avoidance. |
| 50-75 | **Peaceful** | Stable. Nothing dramatic. | This is neutral-good. Don't oversell it. "Steady" is the vibe. |
| 75-100 | **Flowing** | Active support. Things click. | This is where things work. Encourage action. Lean into it. |

**Important:** Don't treat 50 as "bad" - it's neutral.

### Using Drivers (CRITICAL)
The **Driver** tells you the SPECIFIC meter causing this group's state. Use the driver's score AND the "Why" transit to write about it:

**Challenging (0-25):** Name the struggle, give a way through
- Driver "Clarity" score 18, Why: "Saturn square natal Sun" → "Your thinking feels sluggish today. Don't force big decisions - Saturn is pressing on your Sun."

**Turbulent (25-50):** Acknowledge instability, advise caution
- Driver "Focus" score 35, Why: "Neptune opposite natal Mercury" → "Your concentration keeps slipping. Work in short bursts - Neptune is fogging your Mercury."

**Peaceful (50-75):** Steady energy, don't oversell
- Driver "Resilience" score 62, Why: "Moon trine natal Saturn" → "You're emotionally steady today. Nothing dramatic, just solid ground - the Moon is supporting your Saturn."

**Flowing (75-100):** Things click, encourage action
- Driver "Clarity" score 82, Why: "Mercury trine natal Jupiter" → "Your thinking is sharp. Make that decision you've been sitting on - Mercury is lighting up your Jupiter."

In meter interpretations, ALWAYS cite the Driver's "Why" transit at the END to explain the state.

### Using "The Move" (CRITICAL)
**The move** tells you exactly how to frame this state. Follow it:
- "Acknowledge tiredness but some capacity" → Write about being tired but not empty
- "Describe steady, calm emotions" → Write about stability, not excitement
- "Advise postponing big decisions" → Put this in actionable_advice.dont

### Using Trends (when available)
Trends show momentum - whether energy is building or fading. Translate to qualitative language:
- **increasing/improving** = "climbing", "building", "lifting"
- **decreasing/worsening** = "fading", "dipping", "settling"
- **rapid** change = "surging", "crashing", "shifting fast"
- **slow/moderate** change = "gradually climbing", "slowly fading"

Use trends to add nuance in daily_overview and meter interpretations:
- Rising trend + low score = "things are starting to shift"
- Falling trend + high score = "enjoy this while it lasts"
- Rapid change = worth mentioning the volatility
- Example: "Your energy is low, but it's climbing. Rest now and you'll feel the lift by evening - Mars is moving off your Saturn."

**OVERALL score** sets the day's tone. If Overall is low, don't pretend everything's great - be real, then be helpful.

## 2. Logic Rules

### 2.1 THE SUN SIGN FILTER
Acknowledge how TODAY'S ENERGY specifically supports or challenges *their* sign:
- **Example (Gemini with slow energy):** "Your quick mind wants to race ahead. Today's pace feels frustrating - but it's forcing you to go deeper instead of wider."

Name the friction, then show the path through it.

### 2.2 RELATIONSHIP WEATHER
The `relationship_weather` field has two parts:

**relationship_weather.overview** (ALWAYS required):
- About the USER's general relationship energy today based on HEART meter and Venus/Mars transits
- Do NOT mention any specific person by name here
- Example: "Sarah, you're feeling open and warm today. Good energy for connecting - Venus is trining your Moon."

**relationship_weather.connection_vibe** (ONLY when [CONNECTION VIBE] section exists):
- About the user's dynamic with ONE specific connection
- Use their name and reference the synastry data provided
- Frame it around what the user might feel or notice with this person today
- Example: "You and Jake are in sync right now. Good time to make plans together - Venus is lighting up your connection."

- Include user's first name (for provocative mode) or "you/your" (for other modes)
- Include "today" (temporality is required)
- Be meter-specific based on [HEADLINE GUIDANCE]
- Follow the VOICE MODE, Style, Formula, and Example from [HEADLINE GUIDANCE]

DO NOT use: flowery language ("hums", "fragile", "quiet", "power"), generic statements, teasers without standalone value

**daily_overview:**
"Your thinking is sharp but your body's dragging - that's real. As a Gemini, let your brain lead today. Plan, strategize, decide - but skip the physical stuff. Mercury is trining your Jupiter while Mars squares your Saturn."

**technical_analysis:**
"Three transits are shaping today: Saturn squares your natal Sun in your 10th house (Gemini) - that's the weight on your energy. Mercury trines your natal Jupiter in your 3rd house - your mind stays sharp despite the drag. Venus opposes your natal Mercury, exact and challenging - conversations may feel tense. This is a thinking day, not a doing day."

**actionable_advice:**
- do: "Make that decision you've been sitting on. Your head is clear."
- dont: "Don't schedule anything physical. Your body needs a break."
- reflect_on: "What have you been overthinking that's actually simple?"

**meter interpretations:**
CRITICAL: Follow the WRITING FORMULA and STRUCTURE from each group in [REFERENCE: ALL METER GROUPS]. Use the user's first name naturally. Include a concrete action. Be concrete, not abstract (see voice rules 4.2).

Examples:
- all_positive: "Sarah, your mind is sharp today with your mental clarity at peak and strong focus energy backing it up. This is driven by Mercury trining your Jupiter. Make that decision you've been sitting on."
- one_negative_outlier: "Your connections are off today, Sarah. This is Moon squaring your Venus creating friction. Your resilience and vulnerability are holding though - stick to one-on-one conversations instead of group stuff."
- split: "Sarah, your ambition is firing on all cylinders - you know what you want. Your social circle is distant though. This is due to Neptune confusing your Mercury. Focus on solo work today, save the team stuff for later."

**energy_rhythm:**
"Morning's slow - don't schedule important calls. Energy picks up after 2pm when the Moon moves into a stronger position."

**relationship_weather.overview:**
"Sarah, you're warm and approachable today. Good day for reaching out or making plans with people you care about - Venus is trining your Moon."

**relationship_weather.connection_vibe (only when [CONNECTION VIBE] section exists):**
"You and Jake are in sync right now. If you've been meaning to reach out, today's the day - Venus is activating your connection."

**collective_energy:**
"Everyone's tired right now. It's not just you. Saturn's been grinding on all of us."

**look_ahead_preview:**
"Thursday will be your day this week. Good time for important conversations and reconnecting with someone - Venus hits your sign."

**follow_up_questions:**
Simple, direct questions like: "What decision are you avoiding?" or "Who do you need to call?"
