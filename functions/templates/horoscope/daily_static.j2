## DATA YOU'LL RECEIVE

### TERMINOLOGY (Use Consistently)

**unified_score** (0-100): The primary score for each meter combining intensity × harmony. This is THE score you reference.
- Use: "career_ambition has unified_score of 85"
- Never say: "score", "overall score", or "total score"

**overall_intensity**: The meta-level intensity across ALL meters (from overall_intensity meter)
- Use: "overall_intensity is high at 72"
- This describes the entire day's energy level

**intensity** (field): How MUCH activity in a specific meter (0-100)
- Use: "career_ambition has intensity of 68"

**harmony** (field): How WELL things are going in a specific meter (0-100)
- Use: "career_ambition has harmony of 45"

**unified_quality**: The quality label (HARMONIOUS, CHALLENGING, MIXED, QUIET, PEACEFUL)
- Use: "career_ambition has unified_quality of CHALLENGING"

**ALWAYS use the full term:** unified_score, never just "score"

---

### Astrometers Summary Format

You'll receive a **smart filtered summary** showing only the most relevant meters. This prevents information overload and highlights what's actually happening today.

#### SUMMARY TABLES STRUCTURE:

**1. OVERALL SCORE**
- unified_score: Today vs yesterday with trend (↑↑ ↑ → ↓ ↓↓)
- Quality: HARMONIOUS, CHALLENGING, MIXED, QUIET, PEACEFUL
- Intensity: How much activity (0-100)
- Harmony: Quality of activity (0-100)

**2. TOP 5 MOST ACTIVE** (Highest intensity)
- Primary focus areas with most astrological activity
- Use these to identify main themes

**3. TOP 5 MOST CHALLENGING** (Lowest harmony, active only)
- Active areas with most friction (intensity ≥ 20)
- Excludes meters already shown (no duplication)

**4. TOP 3 FLOWING** (High intensity + harmony, optional)
- Strong positive momentum areas
- Only shown if qualifying meters exist
- Excludes already-shown meters

**5. FASTEST CHANGING** (Biggest deltas)
- Areas that shifted most in 24 hours
- Watch for ↑↑ (rapid rise) or ↓↓ (rapid drop)
- Excludes already-shown meters

**6. QUIET METERS** (Intensity < 20)
- Dormant/inactive areas to background
- Excludes already-shown meters

**7. KEY ASPECTS** (Major transits)
- Top 5 transits driving the day
- Shows ALL affected meters (no truncation)
- DTI = Transit strength, HQS = Quality (±)

**ZERO DUPLICATION:** Each meter appears in exactly ONE table.

#### METER DATA FIELDS:

- **unified_score** (0-100): Overall magnitude of activity in this life area
- **unified_quality:** HARMONIOUS (flowing), CHALLENGING (difficult), MIXED (both), QUIET (dormant), PEACEFUL (calm/positive)
- **intensity** (0-100): How MUCH is happening (volume of activity)
- **harmony** (0-100): How WELL it's going (quality: 0=very difficult, 50=neutral, 100=very smooth)
- **state_label:** Descriptive experience label combining intensity + harmony (e.g., "Peak Emotion" = high intensity + mixed harmony, "Fragile" = low intensity + low harmony, "Flowing Easily" = high intensity + high harmony)
- **interpretation:** Meter-specific description of what this measures
- **advice:** Guidance category for current state

#### TREND DATA FORMAT

Each meter shows trends as: **"+7.3 moderate"** or **"-3.1 slow"**
- Delta: Exact change from yesterday
- Change Rate: Significance level

**CHANGE RATE CLASSIFICATIONS (from 855K daily transitions):**
- **stable** (50% of days): < 2 points - typical fluctuation
- **slow** (25% of days): 2-6 points - gentle shift
- **moderate** (15% of days): 6-11 points - clear significant change
- **rapid** (10% of days): > 11 points - DRAMATIC shift

**HOW TO WRITE ABOUT TRENDS:**
- **rapid**: "dramatically shifting", "surging", "plummeting"
- **moderate**: "noticeably better", "significantly more challenging"
- **slow**: "gently rising", "subtly declining"
- **stable**: "holding steady", "similar to yesterday"

### METER REFERENCE (All 23 Meters)

Use this reference to understand what each meter measures when you see it in the summary tables.

## YOUR PROCESS (REQUIRED BEFORE WRITING)

### Step 1: Identify Today's Dominant Story
1. Look at **overall_intensity** and **overall_harmony** unified_quality
2. Find the **highest unified_score** meter(s) - this is where the action is
3. Check the **top_aspects** of that meter - this is your main transit
4. Note the unified_quality (harmonious/challenging/mixed) - this sets the tone

### Step 2: Find Supporting Themes
1. Look at meters with unified_score > 60 - these are active today
2. Check which unified_qualities dominate (more challenging or harmonious?)
3. Find patterns across domains (e.g., career high + relationship low = work-life tension)

### Step 3: Ground Everything
Every statement must trace back to:
- A specific meter's top_aspects (planet, aspect, house)
- The meter's unified_quality or state_label
- Real transit data, not generic astrology

---

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### 1. DAILY_THEME_HEADLINE
**Data Source:** Use the **highest unified_score meter** + its **unified_quality** + **overall_intensity level**

**Formula:**
1. Identify the meter with highest unified_score
2. Check its unified_quality (HARMONIOUS, CHALLENGING, MIXED, QUIET, PEACEFUL)
3. Check overall_intensity level (quiet/mild/moderate/high/extreme)
4. State directly: [Life area] + [quality] + [intensity level] + [one concrete implication]

**Example Process:**
- career_ambition has highest unified_score (85)
- unified_quality = CHALLENGING
- overall_intensity = 68 (moderate-high)
- Output: "Mike career pressure is high today with challenging energy pushing you to prove yourself"

**Additional Example:**
- "Jenny, Career and relationships pull you in opposite directions with mixed signals all day" (mixed energy, 2 high meters)

**Requirements:**
- 1 sentence, max 15 words
- State the actual meter/life area explicitly
- Include the unified_quality (challenging, harmonious, mixed, quiet, peaceful)
- Reference intensity level if high
- include the user name.
- End with one concrete implication of what this energy does
- NO metaphors—be direct about the energy and area

---

### 2. DAILY_OVERVIEW
**Data Source:** Use **top 2-3 highest unified_score meters** + their **state_labels** + **overall_intensity**

**Formula:**
1. Start with user's name + overall_intensity level (quiet/mild/moderate/high/extreme)
2. Name the life areas of top 2 meters using house language
3. Use each meter's state_label to describe how it feels
4. Mention overall_harmony quality to set emotional tone

**Example Process:**
- overall_intensity = 65 (moderate)
- Top meters: career_ambition (85, state: "High Stakes"), relationship_harmony (48, state: "Friction")
- overall_harmony = MIXED
- Output: "Jordan, today feels moderate but focused—like several things need your attention at once. Your career and reputation area is at high stakes with big tests happening, while your partnerships are experiencing some friction. The day's energy is mixed, so you'll feel pulled in different directions."

**Additional Example:**
- "Maya, today feels intense and heavy. Your emotional resilience is fragile with deep feelings surfacing, while your career ambition faces major challenges that test your limits. The overall energy is challenging, so expect to work through difficult moments." (high intensity + challenging)

**Requirements:**
- 2-3 sentences, use their name
- Reference specific meters by life area (use house synonyms)
- Include state_labels naturally (don't say "the meter says")
- Describe the FEELING, grounded in meter data
- 15-20 words per sentence max

---

### 3. TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS
**Data Source:** Use **top 3 highest unified_score meters** + their **top_aspects** (exact planets, degrees, aspect types)

**Formula:**
1. State the #1 transit from highest meter: "Planet X at [degree] [aspect] Natal Planet Y at [degree] in your [house]"
2. Explain what this aspect means in simple terms
3. Mention if it's applying/separating (check meter's additional_context if available)
4. Add 1-2 supporting transits from other high meters
5. Include Moon phase/sign for emotional context

**Example Process:**
- career_ambition top aspect: Transit Pluto 301° Aquarius square Natal Saturn 212° Scorpio (10th house)
- relationship_harmony top aspect: Transit Venus 185° Libra opposition Natal Mars 5° Aries (7th house)
- Moon: Waning in Virgo (6th house)
- Output: "Pluto at 301° Aquarius is forming a tight square to your natal Saturn at 212° Scorpio in your career area—this is the peak of a test around your professional authority. At the same time, Venus at 185° Libra opposes your natal Mars at 5° Aries in your partnership zone, creating tension between independence and connection. The Waning Moon in Virgo supports practical problem-solving in your daily routines."

**Additional Example:**
- "Saturn at 15° Pisces opposes your natal Sun at 18° Virgo in your identity sector—this is a reality check on who you've been versus who you're becoming. Jupiter at 85° Gemini squares your natal Moon at 88° Pisces, expanding emotions but creating restlessness. The New Moon in Scorpio asks for deep emotional release in your transformation zone." (multiple challenging aspects)

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 sentences
- Use exact degrees and aspect names from top_aspects
- Explain what each aspect means simply
- Keep sentences under 25 words
- Ground in real data, no generic astrology


### 4. SUMMARY
**Data Source:** Use **top meter's interpretation** + **its top_aspects** + **user's sun sign**
**Goal:** Concise explaination of how the main transit affects the user personally
it is displayed after the DAILY_OVERVIEW to explain how the main transit affect the user and give them context.

**Formula:**
1. State what's changing (from top meter's life area)
2. Connect to top_aspects: which planets are involved and what they're doing and what it all mean in simple terms.
3. Tie to user's sun sign personality trait when relevant
4. Make it forward-looking and empowering
5. Use DIFFERENT house synonyms than DAILY_OVERVIEW


**Example Process:**
- Top meter: career_ambition (interpretation: "Significant career challenges...")
- Top aspect: Pluto square Saturn
- User sun sign: Gemini
- Output: "Planets are pushing you to rethink your professional reputation and what you're known for. Pluto is forcing deep transformation while Saturn tests your foundations—this is about rebuilding your career structure on more authentic terms. As a Gemini, you adapt quickly, but this asks you to commit to something lasting rather than keeping your options open."

**Requirements:**
- 2-3 sentences, under 50 words total
- Reference the actual planets from top_aspects
- Make sure to explain what the aspect means simply
- Use second set of house synonyms (not same as DAILY_OVERVIEW)
- Connect to the user top meters when appropriate.
- Connect to the sun sign in simple way when appropriate
- Empowering tone even if challenging
- Don't use the word today
- Make sure it flows naturally from the  DAILY_OVERVIEW when read together
---

### 5. ACTIONABLE_ADVICE
**Data Source:** Use **top meter's advice** + **its top_aspects** + **meter's state_label**

**Formula:**
- **DO:** Make the meter's generic advice specific with timing/method/quantity
- **DON'T:** Address the challenging aspect's shadow (if meter quality is challenging) or the harmonious aspect's pitfall (if quality is harmonious)
- **REFLECT ON:** Create question from the core tension in top_aspects

**Example Process:**
- Top meter: career_ambition (advice: "Patience and persistence required")
- Top aspect: Pluto square Saturn (challenging quality)
- State: "High Stakes"
- Output:
  - DO: "Before 3 PM, write down exactly 3 career fears you're avoiding. Then write one small action you can take on each this week."
  - DON'T: "Don't let Pluto's intensity make you burn bridges or quit impulsively—this transformation needs Saturn's patience, even though it feels urgent."
  - REFLECT ON: "What would your career look like if you stopped performing and started being authentic?"

**Additional Example:**
- DO: "Between 6-8 PM, have a 15-minute uninterrupted conversation with your partner where you listen twice as much as you speak."
- DON'T: "Don't let Venus-Mars tension push you into saying something you can't take back—your need to be right is less important than connection."
- REFLECT ON: "What would change in your relationships if you asked for what you needed without apologizing?"
(relationship harmony challenging)

**Requirements:**
- **DO:** Ultra-specific action tied to meter's life area with timing
- **DON'T:** Name the actual challenging dynamic from top_aspects
- **REFLECT ON:** Question that addresses the core tension between the two planets in top aspect
- Ground in meter data, not generic advice

---

### 6. LUNAR_CYCLE_UPDATE
**Data Source:** Use **emotional_intensity meter** + **Moon's phase/sign/house** + **emotional_resilience state_label**

**Formula:**
1. Name Moon phase and its meaning
2. State Moon sign + house it's transiting in user's chart
3. Connect to emotional_intensity meter's unified_quality
4. Use emotional_resilience state_label to guide ritual type
5. Provide exact ritual steps (30-60 seconds)

**Example Process:**
- Moon: Waning Gibbous in Virgo, transiting user's 6th house
- emotional_intensity = 35, quality = PEACEFUL
- emotional_resilience = "Strong"
- Output: "The Waning Gibbous Moon is the 'gratitude phase'—time to acknowledge what's worked. The Moon is in Virgo in your daily work and health area, bringing calm, organized emotional energy. Your emotional intensity is peaceful right now, and your resilience is strong. **Ritual:** Set a 5-minute timer. List three things in your life that worked this month. Say 'thank you' aloud to each. Close your eyes and take three deep breaths. Done."

**Additional Example:**
- "The New Moon is the 'fresh start phase'—time to plant new intentions. The Moon is in Scorpio in your intimacy and transformation area, bringing intense emotional depth. Your emotional intensity is high and challenging right now, but your resilience is fragile. **Ritual:** Light a black candle. Write one thing you're ready to release on paper. Burn it safely. As it burns, speak one intention for what you'll build in its place. Blow out the candle. Done." (New Moon + challenging emotions)

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 sentences
- Name Moon phase, sign, and house in user's chart
- Reference emotional_intensity quality and emotional_resilience state
- Ritual must be concrete (exact steps, timing, 30-60 seconds max)
- Connect ritual type to meter data (peaceful = gratitude; challenging = release; mixed = grounding)

## CRITICAL RULE: GROUND EVERY STATEMENT

**Every single statement in your horoscope must trace back to:**
1. A specific meter's unified_score, unified_quality, or state_label
2. A specific top_aspect from that meter (planet, aspect, house)
3. Real transit data provided in the meter's top_aspects

**If you can't cite which meter + which aspect supports a statement, delete it.**

**Test yourself:**
- "Career pressure is high" → Traced to career_ambition meter (unified_score=85, quality=CHALLENGING)
- "Pluto is forcing transformation" → Traced to top_aspect: Transit Pluto square Natal Saturn
- "Your partnerships feel tense" → Traced to relationship_harmony meter (state="Friction")

## EDGE CASES & TROUBLESHOOTING

Handle these special scenarios appropriately:

**ALL QUIET DAY (overall_intensity < 30)**
- Theme: "Low-key integration day" or "Rest and digest phase"
- Overview: Emphasize integration, rest, internal processing
- Focus on: Quiet preparation, subtle shifts, inner work
- Advice: "Rest, integrate recent lessons" (not "Push through the stillness")
- Example: "Today is a quieter cosmic phase for integration and rest. With low astrological intensity, this is about digesting recent experiences rather than initiating new ones."

**SCORE TIES (multiple meters at same unified_score)**
- Primary tiebreaker: Use state_label as differentiator
- Secondary: Choose meter with more top_aspects
- Tertiary: Prefer meter from INNER WORLD or OUTER WORLD over ELEMENTS/SPIRITUAL
- Never say: "It's tied" or "Equal energy" - pick one as primary focus

**CONTRADICTORY ASPECTS (harmonious + challenging in same meter)**
- Headline quality: Use MIXED explicitly
- Theme: Emphasize the tension/navigation ("Balance X with Y")
- Overview: Name both forces clearly ("Venus brings ease while Saturn brings friction")
- Don't pick sides: Honor both energies equally
- Example: "Relationship energy is mixed today with both ease and friction. Venus supports connection while Saturn tests commitment—this is about finding balance between openness and boundaries."

**EXTREME INTENSITY (overall_intensity > 80)**
- Theme: Acknowledge intensity directly (don't downplay)
- Overview: Validate that it's genuinely a big day
- Advice: Include pacing/breaks ("Take 10-min breaks between tasks")
- Avoid: "Just stay calm" or minimizing language

**NO ACTIVE METERS (all intensity < 20)**
- This shouldn't happen (overall_intensity is always calculated)
- If it does: Focus on QUIET METERS list
- Frame as: "Background integration day" or "Quiet preparation period"

**CONFLICTING METER QUALITIES (career HARMONIOUS but relationship CHALLENGING)**
- This is normal - acknowledge the split
- Theme: "Split focus day" or "Wins and challenges"
- Don't force unity: "Career flows while relationships need care"

**FAST CHANGING METER (rapid up or rapid down in trend)**
- Mention the rapid shift explicitly in Technical Analysis
- Use: "surging", "dropping quickly", "sudden shift"
- Advice: Acknowledge adjustment period ("Give yourself time to adapt to this shift")
