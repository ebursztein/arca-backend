    "overview": "Intuition represents your access to inner knowing, psychic awareness, and ability to sense what isn't visible.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks Uranus and Neptune transits to your natal Uranus, Neptune, and key houses (8th = hidden knowledge and psychic depth, 9th = intuitive wisdom and insight). Uranus brings sudden flashes of insight and breakthrough awareness. Neptune opens psychic channels and dissolves the veil between conscious and unconscious. When these planets form supportive aspects, your intuition is reliable and you receive clear inner guidance. Challenging aspects create confusion between intuition and fear, or overwhelming psychic static. Both retrograde reduce intuitive clarity by 20%.",
