    "overview": "Overall Intensity shows how much cosmic activity is affecting you across all life areas today.",
    "detailed": "This meter aggregates intensity scores from all 17 individual meters to give you the big picture of today's astrological activity level. High intensity means lots of transits are activating your natal chart - not necessarily good or bad, just active. Low intensity means a quieter cosmic day with fewer planetary interactions. This tells you HOW MUCH is happening, not whether it's supportive or challenging (that's Overall Harmony).",
