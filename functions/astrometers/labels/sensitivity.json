    "overview": "Sensitivity represents your emotional awareness, empathy, and attunement to the feelings and energy around you.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks Moon, Venus, and Neptune transits to your natal Moon, Neptune, and 12th house (the unconscious). The Moon shows emotional receptivity. Neptune dissolves boundaries for deep empathy and psychic awareness. Venus adds compassion. When these planets form supportive aspects, your sensitivity is a gift that allows profound connection and intuition. Challenging aspects make you emotionally porous in ways that feel overwhelming - you absorb others' emotions and struggle to maintain boundaries. The 12th house heightens this sensitivity to collective and unconscious feelings.",
