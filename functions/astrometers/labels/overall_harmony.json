    "overview": "Overall Harmony shows whether today's cosmic activity is supportive or challenging across all life areas.",
    "detailed": "This meter aggregates harmony scores from all 17 individual meters to give you the big picture of today's astrological quality. High harmony means most transits are supportive (trines, sextiles) - flowing energy that helps rather than hinders. Low harmony means more challenging transits (squares, oppositions) - friction that requires work. This tells you the QUALITY of cosmic energy, not how much is happening (that's Overall Intensity).",
