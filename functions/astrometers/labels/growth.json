    "overview": "Growth represents your capacity for personal evolution, stepping into new versions of yourself, and life chapter transitions.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks Jupiter and Uranus transits to your natal Jupiter, Uranus, and key houses (5th = creative evolution, 8th = transformational growth, 11th = future self). Jupiter brings expansion and philosophical growth. Uranus creates breakthrough evolution and liberation from old patterns. When these planets form supportive aspects, you grow naturally and feel excited about becoming who you're meant to be. Challenging aspects create growing pains, resistance to change, or overwhelming transformation. Both retrograde reduce growth pressure by 20% while deepening internal evolution.",
