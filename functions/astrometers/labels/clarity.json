    "overview": "Clarity represents your cognitive sharpness, how clearly you think, and how easily you process and communicate information.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks how Mercury transits interact with your natal Mercury, Sun, and Moon, which govern thinking, communication, and mental processing. Mercury aspects to your Sun show overall cognitive function and mental clarity. Aspects to your Moon affect emotional intelligence and intuitive thinking. The 9th house (higher mind and learning) is also monitored. When Mercury forms harmonious aspects, your mind is sharp and communication flows. Challenging aspects create mental fog, miscommunication, or scattered thinking. Mercury retrograde reduces the impact of Mercury transits by 40%.",
