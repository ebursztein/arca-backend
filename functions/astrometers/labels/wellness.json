    "overview": "Wellness represents your daily health routines, work-life balance, and overall sense of physical and mental wellbeing.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks transits through your 6th house (daily routines, health, work habits) and aspects to your natal Moon, Mars, and Saturn. The 6th house shows how your day-to-day life is functioning - work stress, health habits, sleep, exercise, and self-care. The Moon affects emotional wellness and self-nurturing. Mars shows physical energy management. Saturn reveals stress, boundaries, and sustainability of routines. When these are well-aspected, your routines support your health. Challenging aspects create work stress, neglected self-care, or unsustainable habits.",
