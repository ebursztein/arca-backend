    "overview": "Drive represents your motivation to take action, pursue goals, and assert yourself in the world.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks Mars and Uranus transits to your natal Mars, 1st house (identity and action), and 10th house (ambition and achievement). Mars brings raw drive, initiative, and the will to act. Uranus adds sudden motivation and unconventional approaches. When these planets form supportive aspects, you feel motivated and capable of bold action. Challenging aspects create frustration, blocked drive, or impulsive action that backfires. Mars retrograde reduces drive by 35%, requiring strategic pacing rather than forcing.",
