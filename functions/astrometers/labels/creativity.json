    "overview": "Creativity represents your access to creative flow, self-expression, and ability to bring something new into being.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks Venus and Neptune transits to your natal Venus, Neptune, and 5th house (creative self-expression, art, play, joy). Venus brings aesthetic sensitivity and the desire to create beauty. Neptune dissolves creative blocks and opens channels to the muse. When these planets form supportive aspects, creative energy flows naturally and you feel inspired. Challenging aspects create creative blocks, self-doubt, or overwhelming inspiration that's hard to ground. Venus retrograde reduces creative flow by 30%, Neptune by 20%.",
