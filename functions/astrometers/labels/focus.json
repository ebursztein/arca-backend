    "overview": "Focus represents your ability to concentrate, stay on task, and direct your attention without distraction.",
    "detailed": "This meter monitors how Saturn and Mars transits interact with your natal Mercury, showing your capacity for sustained concentration and mental discipline. Saturn brings structure and focus but can feel restrictive. Mars adds mental drive and urgency but can create restlessness. The 6th house (work routines) and 8th house (deep concentration) are tracked. When these planets form supportive aspects, you can concentrate deeply and work productively. Challenging aspects scatter attention or create mental resistance to focused work.",
