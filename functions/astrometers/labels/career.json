    "detailed": "This meter tracks Saturn transits to your natal Saturn and 10th house (career, public life, professional achievement). Saturn brings structure, responsibility, hard-earned success, and career tests. When Saturn forms supportive aspects, your professional efforts pay off and you build lasting career foundations. Challenging aspects create career obstacles, professional setbacks, or heavy responsibilities that feel overwhelming. Saturn retrograde reduces career pressure by 20% but can slow external momentum while deepening internal mastery.",
