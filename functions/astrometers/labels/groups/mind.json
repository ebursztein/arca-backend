    "overview": "Mind represents your cognitive sharpness, ability to concentrate, and ease of expressing yourself.",
    "detailed": "This group combines three mental functions: Mental Clarity (how clearly you think), Focus (your ability to concentrate), and Communication (how easily you express ideas). Together they show whether your mind is sharp and flowing or foggy and scattered. High scores mean you're thinking clearly, staying focused, and communicating effectively. Low scores suggest mental fog, distractions, or difficulty finding words.",
