    "detailed": "This group combines four spiritual dimensions: Purpose (life direction and meaning), Connection (spiritual belonging and unity), Intuition (psychic awareness and inner guidance), and Creativity (creative flow and self-expression). Together they show your overall spiritual and creative state. High scores mean you feel aligned with purpose, spiritually connected, intuitively clear, and creatively flowing. Low scores suggest feeling lost, isolated, cut off from intuition, or creatively blocked.",
