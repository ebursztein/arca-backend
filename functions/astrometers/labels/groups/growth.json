    "detailed": "This group combines four growth dimensions: Opportunities (favorable timing and doors opening), Career (professional momentum and recognition), Growth (personal evolution and life transitions), and Social Life (friendships and community connections). Together they show your overall external growth and expansion. High scores mean doors are opening, career is flowing, you're evolving naturally, and social connections feel easy. Low scores suggest closed doors, career obstacles, resistance to change, or social isolation.",
