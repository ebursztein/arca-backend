    "overview": "Vitality represents your physical energy, stamina, and life force available for daily activities and bold action.",
    "detailed": "This meter tracks your core vitality by monitoring how Mars and the Sun in the sky interact with your natal Sun, Mars, and key houses (1st house = identity and physical body, 5th house = creative expression). When these planets form supportive aspects like trines and sextiles, you feel energized and capable. Challenging aspects like squares and oppositions can deplete energy or create resistance that requires more effort to push through. Saturn transits can temporarily drain reserves but build long-term stamina when worked with intentionally.",
