Validation tests for astrometers - ensuring meters produce different scores and change at different rates.

These tests check fundamental correctness:
1. Meters should NOT all have identical scores on the same day
2. Meters should change at different rates from day to day
3. Filtering logic should result in different aspect sets per meter
