# Label Writing Guide for Astrometers

## Overview

This guide defines how to write experience labels for all astrometer states. These labels appear in the app UI and must sound like a wise friend texting you about today's energy.

**Context:** Labels complete these phrases:
- Individual meters: "Mental Clarity: **[label]**"
- Group energy: "Mind Cosmic Energy: **[label]**"
- Overall: "Today Cosmic Energy: **[label]**"

## Core Tone Principles

### Voice: Wise Friend Texting (NOT Mystical Guru)

✅ **DO:** Direct, actionable, honest, relatable
- "Foggy thoughts"
- "Building momentum"
- "Heart's open wide"
- "Low but steady"

❌ **DON'T:** Mystical, vague, dramatic, fatalistic
- "Cosmic fog descending"
- "Karmic lessons emerging"
- "Soul transmutation"
- "Can't think straight"

### Empowering & Optimistic (Core Principle)

Even on challenging days, frame labels around **growth, agency, and opportunity**.
- Lead with what's possible, not what's difficult
- Challenges are growth moments, not problems
- Help users see their power and potential

✅ **Empowering reframes:**
- NOT "Totally blocked" → "Building patience"
- NOT "Emotional mess" → "Processing deeply"
- NOT "Can't focus" → "Mind needs rest"
- NOT "Really struggling" → "Growing through it"

### Language Level: GenZ / 8th Grade

- **Short:** 2-3 words max
- **Simple:** No academic/mystical words (catalyze, manifestation, archetypal, transmutation)
- **Concrete:** Describe actual feelings, not cosmic concepts
- **Scannable:** Quick to read and understand

### Zero Mystical BS

This is for GenZ women navigating real life (relationships, career, transitions).

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Divine alignment"
- "Cosmic storm"
- "Karmic release"
- "Soul calling"
- "Spiritual awakening"

✅ **Use:**
- "Really clear"
- "All over"
- "Heart's open"
- "Finding direction"
- "Connecting deeply"

## The Label Matrix (15 States Per Meter)

| **moderate** | 50-75 | Normal daily activity, noticeable energy |
| **high** | 75-90 | Strong activity, lots happening |
| **extreme** | 90-100 | Maximum activity (rare), overwhelming |

### 3 Quality Bands

| Quality | Harmony Score | Meaning |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **challenging** | < 40 | Difficult aspects dominate, growth through struggle |
| **mixed** | 40-60 | Balance of supportive and challenging aspects |

## Testing Your Labels

Read each label aloud in context:

**Individual meter:**
> "Today your Mental Clarity: **[label]**"

**Group:**
> "Your Mind Cosmic Energy: **[label]**"

Ask yourself:
1. Would I text this exact phrase to a friend?
2. Is it empowering (even if challenging)?
3. Is it concrete (describes actual feeling)?
4. Is it 2-3 words?
5. Zero mystical BS?

If all 5 = YES, the label works.
