When Castor was killed, Pollux begged his father Zeus to share his immortality. Zeus placed them in the heavens as the constellation Gemini, forever alternating between Olympus and the Underworld. This myth represents the sign's inherent duality, its search for a 'missing half,' and the tension between the mortal and divine realms.",

  "summary": "Gemini, the third sign of the zodiac, is an adaptable Air sign ruled by the swift-footed planet Mercury. Symbolized by the Celestial Twins, Gemini embodies duality, communication, and insatiable curiosity. This sign governs the realm of the intellect, acting as the zodiac's messenger and information network.

Their life purpose is to connect, question, and cross-pollinate ideas, weaving together the fabric of human connection through the power of language.",
