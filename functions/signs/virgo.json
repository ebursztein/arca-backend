  "summary": "Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac, is a mutable earth sign ruled by Mercury. Symbolized by the Maiden, Virgo is the archetype of the meticulous analyst, dedicated servant, and pragmatic healer. Their core mission is to bring order, purity, and functional improvement to the material world. Possessing a sharp, detail-oriented intellect, they are driven by a profound desire to be useful and to perfect their craft. Virgo's greatest challenge lies in managing their inner critic, a tendency toward perfectionism and anxiety that stems from a deep-seated feeling of inadequacy. Their evolutionary journey is to learn self-compassion, to embrace the beauty of imperfection, and to offer their considerable gifts of refinement from a place of wholeness and grace.",
