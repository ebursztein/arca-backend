# new meters proposal

**The Vibe:** A **Real, Grounded "Wise Friend."**
**The Goal:** Empowerment. We don't fix them; we tell them where they stand so they can handle it.

Here is the revised proposal.

### 1. THE GROUP NAMES (Clean & Human)

We keep these simple. Using overly clever names for the *Groups* creates confusion. We save the personality for the *Meters*.

*   **MIND** (Keep standard)
*   **HEART** (Warm, human, less clinical than "Emotions")
*   **BODY** (Keep standard)
*   **INSTINCTS** (Replaces "Spirit." It’s practical. It’s your gut. It’s not magic.)
*   **GROWTH** (Keep standard)

### 2. THE SPECIFIC METERS (Sub-Data)

Here is where we shift to "Empowering" and "Real."

#### **Group: MIND**
| Old Meter | **New Meter Name** | **Why** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mental Clarity | **Clarity** | Simple. |
| Focus | **Focus** | Simple. |
| Communication | **Voice** | "Voice" is empowering. It’s about being heard, not just talking. |
| Logic | **Strategy** | "Strategy" implies you are in control and making moves. |

#### **Group: HEART**
| Old Meter | **New Meter Name** | **Why** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sensitivity | **Resilience** | Measures how well you handle the feels, not just that you have them. |
| Mood | **Outlook** | "Outlook" is about perspective, which feels actionable. |
| Relationship | **Connections** | **(Plural)**. Covers friends, lovers, and networking. |
| Openness | **Vulnerability** | Strength through openness. A key Millennial/Gen Z value. |

#### **Group: BODY**
| Old Meter | **New Meter Name** | **Why** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Vitality | **Battery** | Universal. You have a charge, you deplete it, you fill it. |
| Health | **Strength** | Replaces "Glow." Focuses on capability and power. |
| Movement | **Drive** | The physical impulse to get things done. |
| Rest | **Recovery** | "Recovery" sounds like an athlete; "Rest" sounds like doing nothing. |

#### **Group: INSTINCTS (was Spirit)**
| Old Meter | **New Meter Name** | **Why** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Psychic | **Gut Check** | The Wise Friend asks: "What does your gut say?" |
| Dreams | **Vision** | Replaces "Downloads/Dreams." It’s about seeing the path forward. |
| Luck | **Timing** | Empowering. It’s not random luck; it’s being in sync with the clock. |

#### **Group: GROWTH**
| Old Meter | **New Meter Name** | **Why** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Career | **Ambition** | Career is a job; Ambition is your internal fire. |
| Discipline | **Grind** | You liked this. It acknowledges the hard work. |
| Transformation | **Evolution** | Natural, biological growth. |

### 3. THE 4-BUCKET STATES (The "Score" Labels)

This is the code logic. We want words that validate the struggle (Low) and celebrate the power (High).

**Logic:**
*   **Bucket 1:** The Challenge (Real talk)
*   **Bucket 2:** The Middle/Unsure (Validating)
*   **Bucket 3:** The Good (Steady)
*   **Bucket 4:** The Peak (Empowered)

```swift
case "mind":
    // From "I can't think" to "I'm a genius"
    return ("Overloaded", "Hazy", "Clear", "Sharp")

case "emotions": // (Heart)
    // From "It hurts" to "I'm open"
    return ("Heavy", "Raw", "Steady", "Open")

case "body":
    // From "Empty tank" to "Full power"
    return ("Empty", "Lagging", "Ready", "Charged")

case "spirit": // (Instincts)
    // From "Confused" to "Knowing"
    return ("Silent", "Doubting", "Trusting", "On Point")

case "growth":
    // From "Hard work" to "Results"
    return ("Uphill", "Pacing", "Climbing", "Unstoppable")

default:
    return ("Challenging", "Mixed", "Peaceful", "Flowing")
```

### Why this works better:
1.  **"Raw" vs "Uneasy":** "Raw" validates that feelings are near the surface, but it's not negative. It’s real.
2.  **"On Point" vs "Awakened":** "On Point" is how a friend compliments your judgment. "Awakened" is a guru on a mountain.
3.  **"Uphill" vs "Stuck":** "Stuck" feels hopeless. "Uphill" implies you are still moving, it's just hard. That is empowering.
4.  **"Empty" vs "Drained":** "Empty" is a clear signal to refill.

Does this feel more like the "Wise Friend" voice you want?
