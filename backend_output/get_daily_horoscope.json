Jupiter expands opportunities and brings good fortune. Venus attracts favorable circumstances and helpful people. When these planets form supportive aspects, opportunities appear naturally and timing works in your favor. Challenging aspects create missed timing, doors that stay closed, or opportunities that look good but aren't. Jupiter retrograde reduces opportunity flow by 30%, Venus by 30%.",
