The Sun at 15° Scorpio squares your natal Moon at 15° Gemini, creating tension between your hidden desires and your need for intellectual expression.

Your mind is in quiet reflection because Neptune is subtly challenging Mercury, making it hard to pin down clear thoughts, especially regarding your career. Your social life is solo time, as a quiet preparation phase unfolds. As a Gemini, you usually crave connection, but today asks for inner exploration and patience with uncertainty.",
